# JAVASCRIPT  IMPORTANT NOTES


## JavaScript Variable Declarations and Dynamic Typing

## Variable Declarations
- In JavaScript, variables can be declared using `var`, `let`, or `const`.
- `var` has issues with block scope and functional scope, making it outdated.
- `let` allows variables to be declared with block scope, enhancing predictability.
- `const` is used for declaring constants. Once assigned, its value cannot be reassigned.

## Dynamic Typing
- JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, similar to Python.
- Variables can be defined and initialized without using any keyword.

## Variable Initialization
- Variables can be defined without initializing them, resulting in a value of `undefined`.

## Console Output
- The `console.log()` function is used to output data to the console.
- `console.table()` can be used to display data in tabular format.

## Variable Types and Assignments
- `var` is outdated due to scope issues. `let` and `const` are commonly used in modern JavaScript.
- Attempting to reassign a value to a `const` variable results in an error.
