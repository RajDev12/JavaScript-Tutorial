# JAVASCRIPT  IMPORTANT NOTES


## JavaScript Variable Declarations and Dynamic Typing

## Variable Declarations
- In JavaScript, variables can be declared using `var`, `let`, or `const`.
- `var` has issues with block scope and functional scope, making it outdated.
- `let` allows variables to be declared with block scope, enhancing predictability.
- `const` is used for declaring constants. Once assigned, its value cannot be reassigned.

## Dynamic Typing
- JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, similar to Python.
- Variables can be defined and initialized without using any keyword.

## Variable Initialization
- Variables can be defined without initializing them, resulting in a value of `undefined`.

## Console Output
- The `console.log()` function is used to output data to the console.
- `console.table()` can be used to display data in tabular format.

## Variable Types and Assignments
- `var` is outdated due to scope issues. `let` and `const` are commonly used in modern JavaScript.
- Attempting to reassign a value to a `const` variable results in an error.



# Data Types in JavaScript

- **Number**: Represents numerical values. In JavaScript, numbers are represented as 64-bit floating-point numbers, with precision up to 2 to the power 53.
- **BigInt**: Used for representing integers of arbitrary length.
- **String**: Represents textual data enclosed within quotes.
- **Boolean**: Represents logical values - `true` or `false`.
- **null**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
- **undefined**: Indicates that a variable has been declared but not assigned any value.

## Additional Notes

- The `alert()` function is specific to the browser environment and is used to display an alert dialog.
- Objects are also a data type in JavaScript, but they are not explicitly demonstrated in this code snippet.

## Console Output

- Outputs the string `"hi"` to the console.
- Logs the data types of variables `a`, `null`, and `undefined`, which are `"number"`, `"object"`, and `"undefined"` respectively.
